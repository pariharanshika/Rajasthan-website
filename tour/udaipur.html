<div>
<p class="text-dark text-justify font-xs">One of the most charming places to visit in Udaipur, Doodh Talai is a lake very close to Lake Pichola.<br>
     Even though it is just a small pond, Doodh Talai (literally meaning, ‘Milk Pond’) attracts visitors to its two parks that lie on adjacent hillocks. <br>
     The Manikya Lal Verma Garden is a municipal park that affords beautiful views of the Lake Pichola and houses <br>
     the Karni Mata Temple that also attracts many visitors. <br>
    Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay Park is the other public park hemmed to Doodh Talai and attracts visitors to its musical fountain – a first in Rajasthan.<br>

<div>
<p class="text-dark text-justify font-xs">This beautiful man-made lake with its striking blue-hued waters against the backdrop of green hills is what has earned Udaipur its sobriquet of “The Second Kashmir”. <br>
    Exceptionally clean and expansive, the Fateh Sagar Lake is a great place to visit in Udaipur mainly for its 4 islands that are attractions in themselves.<br>
     Accessible only by boat, the islands play host to public parks and a solar observatory that is worth a see. <br>
    The lake in Udaipur, named after Maharana Fateh Singh of Udaipur and Mewar, is a central to the city’s life that not only<br>
     supplies water to the urban areas but also provides employment to a large fraction of the populace.<br>

<p class="text-dark text-justify font-xs">The Indo-Aryan Jagdish Temple owes its creation to the Maharana Jagat Singh. <br>
    The temples in Udaipur lies near the City Palace’s Badi Pol entry and you have to go up through a few steps. <br>
    The black stone deity of Lord Vishnu will awe you and so will the brass Garuda image facing it. <br>
    There are many other shrines dedicated to the Sun God, Lord Ganesha, Lord Shiva and Goddess Shakti.<br>
     The sunset Aarti will be a wonderful experience here.

<div>
<p class="text-dark text-justify font-xs">Jaisamand Lake, also known as Dhebar Lake is one of the most beautiful water bodies in Udaipur and is also one of the largest artificial lakes in the world. <br>
    One of most popular places to visit in Udaipur, the lake was formed by the famed Marble Dam built by Maharana Jai Singh in 1685.<br>
     The marble dam is in itself quite the attraction as are the marble statues and chatris that dot the structure.<br>
      Enjoy boat rides in the lake and visit the summer palaces built around the lake for the queens.<br>
     You could also spend time at the Jaisamand Wildlife Sanctuary located on the lake watching out for panthers, wild boar and migratory birds.<br>

<p class="text-dark text-justify font-xs">Constructed in 1362 AD, most likely by a banjara tribesman, Lake Pichola today is an iconic symbol of Udaipur. <br>
    Measuring nearly 4 Km in length and 3 Km in width, the lake is a must-see place to visit in Udaipur. <br>
    A myriad of palaces, temples, royal quarters and ghats and chabutaras have been developed around the lake and on its several islands over the years.<br>
     These structures like the Lake Palace and Jag Mandir are the most popular sites here but for a fresh experience we’d recommend taking a boat from the City Palace to the Arsi Vilas Island to go explore the bird sanctuary it hosts.<br>

     This awe-inspiring development catered to the maids who would go with the Princess of Udaipur to her husband’s hearth (part of the dowry given by the Maharana).<br>
      This place had pretty women dancing, singing and making merry and the beautiful marble elephants, fountains, <br>
      a lotus pool and kiosks bear ample testimony to the richness of the time.<br>
