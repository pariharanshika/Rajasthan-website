<p class="text-dark text-justify font-xs">Bikaner has several havelis (aristocratic homes), the most famous cluster being the Rampuria Group of Havelis.<br>
     Built of dulmera (red) stone, every aspect of the havelis – jharokhas (casements), entrances, latticed windows, divankhanas, gumaharias or basements –<br>
      is simply exotic. Leaves and flowers decorate every jharokha, lending it a pleasant touch. <br>
      These massive havelis are decorated with golden work of the highest quality. Their dankhanas (drawing room) take one back to the Mughal and Rajput era.<br>
       One can notice an abundance of Victorian influence in their design as well. <br>
    The wood carvings in Rampuria Havelies are extremely exquisite.<br>
     Spaced close to each other, the havelis are truly a sight to behold.<br>
